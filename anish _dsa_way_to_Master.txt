segmanet treaa sk rarealy  just know about 


time and space complexity 



1 : starts with basic  : - 

what it is 
how to repreent in code 
different operation you can perform on it 
time/ s[ace complexity 



ex : - binar tree 


what is binry tree 

how it implement in code 
common operation like : - inserting a node deleteing node  searching a node 

2 : learn real-word applications 

use pen and paper to learn data structure and algorithm 
implement it from scratch 
solve easy problem . try solving 4 to 5 eacy problem on leat code .



know pattern : -
